A large number of image file formats are available for storing graphic data, the most popular being JPG and PNG. That's why I've created an image converter GUI with Python to convert PNG to JPG.

To create an Image converter GUI with Python, I've used the Tkinter library. Other than Tkinter I've also used PIL library in Python which stands for Python Imaging Library.


And the result:

As you can see the output window, it will work the same as all other applications installed in your system. You first need to select a PNG file then click on the button to convert PNG to JPG, then you just need to select a folder where you want to save your converted image.
