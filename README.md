A large number of image file formats are available for storing graphic data, the most popular being JPG and PNG. That's why I've created an image converter GUI with Python to convert PNG to JPG.
To create an Image converter GUI with Python, I've used the Tkinter library, which is the best known Python framework for building GUI application. Other than Tkinter I've also used PIL library in Python which stands for Python Imaging Library.
